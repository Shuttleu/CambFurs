# Rules

- Safe for work content only. This means no NSFW discussion or images.
- No discussion or images of illegal content or activities. This includes drugs.
- No “heavy” or “extreme” kinks in images or discussion. This includes vore and gore.
- Over 16s only in chat. If you indicate you are under 16 you are liable to be removed.
- No discriminatory content. This includes anything related to disability, sex, gender identity, sexuality, or race. 
- Don’t harass or bully group members, either through direct messages or in chat.
- No politics in group chat.
- Don’t argue with the admins in chat. If an admin asks you to stop, stop. If you disagree, take it to a direct message.

## Cambridge Furs is a social space and not a dating group.

We want to keep the group safe, friendly, and enjoyable for everyone (both online and at meets). Please do not take anything anyone says as an invitation to hit on them. Anyone reported as cruising (specifically looking for dates) will be asked to leave the group and may not be invited back.

## Additional context for those who want it:

- The Cambridge Furs is a safe for work chat. This is for several reasons:
    - A number of people can be made very uncomfortable by not safe for work images or chat. This should be a comfortable environment for people to socialise and relax.
    - Apple devices only display safe for work chat groups in Telegram. Ones flagged as not safe for work will not be displayed and as such would not allow a number of our group members to see the room.
- It should be obvious that we don’t condone illegal activities of any kind. Drugs have been particularly highlighted as discussions of the use of either illegal drugs, or the misuse of drugs, have a tendency to spiral out of control.
- Discussion of “heavy” or “extreme” kinks can easily make those not interested in them uncomfortable. This can occur even if the kinks are not explicitly sexual in nature. We want this to be somewhere people can feel comfortable engaging in social chat.
- Over 16s only. Whilst the chat is safe for work, and should be suitable for all ages, as this is a public chat we cannot guarantee this.
- Discrimination on the grounds of any protected characteristic is not something we will tollerate. This includes any racism, sexisim, homophobia, or transphobia. If you want to understand more about protected characteristics the UK government and Citizens Advice have more information on protected characteristics here:
    - [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/)
    - [UK Government](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/4)
- Harassment of group members, either in the chat or in DM, will not be tolerated. It’s more complex than this, but if someone asks you to stop messaging them or that you’re making them uncomfortable, just stop.
- Whilst politics is an important subject it’s one where people often have strong opinions and tend to devolve very quickly into toxic and unpleasant chat. To avoid this we’re not allowing discussion of politics. Encouragement of people to vote is fine, but not with discussion around specific parties or policies.
